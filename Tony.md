# Hello From Tony

## Looking Forward to Enhancment Proposal wiki

I will fill out the template once it is created for ODC-lite


## OSIP 123 - Implement a simple ODC-lite package as a precursor for those interested in ODC

### Bunt might be scared off by the enormity of Open Data Cube

### Overview
Proposed By

#### Tony Butzer




*Assigned to Release: None* 
- this is standalone companion software outside of core.

This proposal is for a simple odc-lite repository
State

    Under Discussion
     --> In Progress
    Completed
    Rejected
    Deferred

### Motivation

ODC has tremendous application potential.

However; ODC is difficult to install and has a huge dependency tree. Xarray concepts and jupyter notebooks may be foreign to most initail ODC onlookers.

This package makes it so simple even a cave-man can run an ODC like notebook. Then once hooked more sophisticated applications can be acheived by using ODC.

This will be a separate repo - its documented here to fit into the bigger picture of ODC sponsored events and as part of the training package - titled "A gentle introduction to Open Data Cube; Your Data on Display"
